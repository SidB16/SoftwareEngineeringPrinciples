If youre reading this, it implies that you're interested in learning more about Eiffel.

I recommand using the following resources:

To get started,

Once comfortable with syntax, 
3) https://www.eiffel.org/documentation - Offcial Eiffel Documentation (should be all you need).
4) http://eiffel-guide.com/
